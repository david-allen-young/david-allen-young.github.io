Software Development Engineer </br> 
<blockquote>
I am a Software Development Engineer at Advanced Soundware with over 6 years of experience engineering full stack cross-platform products. I’ve largely worked on high-performance, event-driven, multi-threaded desktop applications for MacOS and Windows using C++ and SQL but consider myself a software generalist. I am a domain expert in music, audio, and video, with extensive experience in the film and television industry, including both broadcast and post-production environments, but am eager to challenge myself and dive into new industries and tech stacks.
